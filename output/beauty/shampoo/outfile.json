My hair was brittle and seemed always dry no matter what products I would put on it. I thought that I would have had to cut my hair and start completely over. However, when my products arrived, I could not wait to give them a try. I love the smells. Very nice and not powerful. I washed my hair twice with the Nexxus Shampoo, first time just the scalp, and the second wash, the hair itself. The way that my hair reacted to this shampoo was breathtaking! My curls appeared and believe it or not, I was able to pull a comb through my thick, natural, 4C  hair!! I have never, ever been able to do this before while washing. Barely any hair was coming out in my comb! I had not even used the conditioner yet. I just had to stop and look in the mirror and talk to myself saying, \"Omg, I cannot believe this\"! I have never, ever experienced a shampoo doing my hair like this before. After I completely rinsed the shampoo from my hair, I moved on to the Nexxus Conditioner. Even more amazing. It stated to leave on the hair for 3 min, but I sat under a hooded dryer for about 10min with the conditioner on my hair, under a plastic cap. Once my time was up, I rinsed away all of the conditioner. My hair was so manageable!! I was able to comb and section it to do my bantu knots and allow my hair to dry overnight. After washing my hair, it only took me about 30 min to get it  all done to dry. I have never been able to complete this process this quickly before! I am highly satisfied with these products! Even though they are  expensive products, I'm hooked and will be purchasing again. I told my mom about my experience and am ready to try it on her hair also, to see if she gets the same experience and satisfaction that I got. Thank you Nexxus for such wonderful products, and thank you Amazon for carrying them. Definitely a must try on the Nexxus Keraphix Shampoo and Conditioner for Severely damaged hair. This is my first time ever writing a review on a product. That's how pleased I was with these products!!", "review_title": "The Nexxus Keraphix Shampoo and Conditioner are amazing products", "stars_data": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "images": null}, {"review_text": "I first received this shampoo and conditioner in a beauty box. Out of the hundreds of samples received throughout the years, this was the first product I was compelled to buy. My hair was dry and lifeless. This shampoo/conditioner makes my hair shiny and so soft. I've used more shampoos than I can count and this is the first to give me noticeable results after just one use. I will say that if you are sensitive to perfume smells, this may be too strong for you. I enjoy the sent and the fact that my hair holds that sent beyond 24 hours. Even after using a different shampoo for a day, the smell of this one still comes through. Also, if you are prone to greasy hair, this may make it worse. I do not have this issue typically, but at the end of the day after using this, there is a subtle heaviness to my roots.

It is nothing like I\u2019ve used before. I say that for several reasons \u2026 * Texture \u2013 the shampoo is thick, but I have had to use more than usual on my hair, and I have medium length hair. * Performance \u2013 this actually thickens my hair. I don\u2019t have ultra thin hair, but this adds some bulk to it, more so when my hair is in its \u201ccurly\u201d phase. It also makes my hair softer even before adding the conditioner. * Cleanliness \u2013 once in my hair, it feels like it never washes out, but it is washed out. My hair does feel cleaner than with the other brands I\u2019ve used, except for my \u201cnormal\u201d brand (Garnier Whole Blends \u2013 Honey Treasures) which always feels clean. As far as the \u201cscent\u201d, Keraphix has a soft, pleasant scent. It doesn\u2019t linger too long after the hair is dried, unless you put your hair to your nose. As Nexxus brands are found in salons, this is definitely salon quality. It does most of what it promises, but nothing is 100% accurate or perfect. To date I haven\u2019t found a shampoo (or conditioner) that is 100% perfect and I\u2019ve used all brands out there. I alternate the Keraphix system with another hair care system.

I will say that I was worried at first while I was washing my hair because it felt \u201cheavy\u201d and like my hair would be greasy as someone else in the reviews had stated. I do have thin hair so this is a concern. However what you need to know is that as soon as you put the conditioner on that feeling disappears so make sure you condition all the way to your roots. I know that\u2019s typically not recommended but I believe this shampoo and conditioner are made to treat and repair the entire hair strand. Also, it smells amazing. The thing I would compare the smell to is the Moroccan hair treatment oils that are out there. Very pleasant and it lasts after styling which I like because I love to smell good!

It looked like the same stuff (same bottle, same shampoo color & consistency) but what made me suspicious was the difference in smell. The primary scent of the shampoo from Amazon is tea tree oil (sort of similar to Pine-Sol).  The primary scent of the stuff from the salon is peppermint with a background tea tree oil scent (a much nicer smell overall).  Then I used the salon stuff to wash my hair.  Wow, what a difference.  The salon stuff had a better tingle, it created a much thicker lather, rinsed cleaner, and left my hair with more body. Over the next four days, I tested my theory by washing my hair with the Amazon-bought shampoo one day and the salon-bought shampoo the next day.

I give the counterfeit shampoo two stars because it wasn't bad, but the real Paul Mitchell shampoo is so much better and I paid for the good stuff.

Unfortunately, although the ingredients have apparently not changed (see photos of new bottle vs old bottle), the proportions and/or quality of them have.

The new stuff cleans well, but really strips your hair, leaving it somewhat dry and in need of conditioning.

In the past I\u2019ve used other more expensive brands of shampoo and conditioner but nothing gave me these quick of results.

To be honest, I was super skeptical. I've tried a lot of \"natural\" products that were just a bold-faced lie or didn't work. I've developed a healthy dose of skepticism. This product surpassed my expectations! My hair: pretty long, down to the middle/small of my back. Not color treated but naturally frizzy, medium curly/wavy and very dry.  The only heat I apply is using a straightener every couple of days on low heat. Maybe once a month I blow-dry. I try to be as good to it as I can otherwise it turns into a pure mess of straw in a rat's nest. 1) INGREDIENTS: The ingredients list is not hiding anything nasty. I looked all of them up on SkinDeep and they all passed the test. Dimethicone and fragrance are the only ones you can get nitpicky about but that's really making a mountain out of a molehill. From what I can tell, the only thing that would be gentler on hair is just washing with water. Other \"Sulfate Free\" hair products are so saturated with other harmful chemicals that sulfates are the least of your problems. I'd say this product is 99% toxin free. That's more than good enough for me. Actually, it's really amazing. I'm impressed with what they were able to accomplish with so few ingredients and how natural they are. 2) EXPERIENCE: wow. I love my hair after using this. My hair is soft, easy to work with, less tangled and frizzy. It's just healthier! It straightens easier and if I choose to do nothing to it, it's not a mess so horrid that I can't leave the house. Can't really speak for thickening or volume but I didn't get it for that. I am more interested in that it's a toxin free product that actually works. 3) CONS: The only con is that my hair gets greasier faster. I wash my hair every 3-4 days. With this, I'm having to wash a day earlier, every 3 days or so. That's SO minor. But I mention it because if others experience it, understand that this isn't necessarily a bad thing. It means fewer oils are stripped out of your hair to begin with. Also, it feels like a detox period. I'll have to wait to see if it gets better or worse over time. Again, totally minor and actually, to be expected if you've ever tried the \"no-poo\" approach. 4) FRAGRANCE: What others have said about a clean spa smell is about right. It's not a heavy perfume smell but it's not light and airy. It smells like what you think hair products should smell like. One thing that is distinctive is that it smells high-end. Does that make any sense? Overall, I think I found a shampoo I want to use for the foreseeable future. I'm amazed by ingredients. My hair felt healthier after the first use and has been great every time since then. It's a natural hair system with the convenience rarely found in such products. Again, this is MUCH more than just sulfate-free. It's 99% toxin free. For me, this stuff actually does what it advertises to do and that's a minor miracle in itself.

I use 2 pumps of shampoo and concentrate just on my scalp and 2 to 3 pumps of conditioner that I dont put on my scalp at all. I bought a set for me and for my mom, she is also so in love. She has very short and thin hair and is also cutting out alcohol or any other damaging ingredients in her hair products. She works for Paul Mitchell and gets her hair done often so it gets abused!

He did immediately and it even arrived a few days earlier than expected. Great customer service!! Ok now about the product. I love that it doesn't have sulfates or a lot of chemicals and is professional strength. I had to let my hair go natural, salt and pepper, after severe allergic reaction to hair dyes two yrs ago. I use products on my hair and face very organic and natural.  Like using coconut oil when styling my hair. I've recently starting adding avocado oil to the shampoo before putting it on my hair. It's helped a lot. My hair is curly, and living in Florida, it could get very frizzy in the summer months. I like to wear it smooth and use a flat iron after drying. The shampoo and conditioner is so moisturizing and would be good for any hair types, but I think especially for us curly gals. I used to get Keratin treatments at the salon a number of years ago, but stopped because of expense and the chemicals. I'm able to get pretty much the same results using this product.

It also has a very thin watery texture that makes me question if it is really effective against the sun. It is very easy to spread all over the skin and doesn't leave a white cast. One thing I noticed that once it dries if I touch or rub my face, the product gums up and turns into little sticky balls that look like boogers  all over my face.

First things first - it's been great for my sensitive skin and scalp. For most of my life, I've had red/itchy skin despite trying all sorts of high end, expensive products targeted towards sensitive skin, It was only last year (after 10 years of skin abuse) that I realized the culprit for my blotchy/red skin was the shampoos I was using. I tried a few other shampoos which didn't have any impact on improving my skin, but within 1-2 washes of using this product - I could see the perpetual blotches on my face clearing up because of finally not being irritated by harsh chemicals. This shampoo has been great for my sensitive skin, and does not break me out at all. Now for the \"not so great\" parts - a) This shampoo does not suds well at all, which makes application difficult. It takes a lot of product for me to ensure I clean all of my scalp, because it's difficult to spread around. I know that generally sulphate-free shampoos don't sud, and given how \"clean\" this shampoo is with it's ingredient list - I can live with the trade-off - but purchase this product with clear expectations. b) Extremely drying - I absolutely can NOT use this product without a conditioner. It leaves your hair feeling \"squeaky clean\" which is not necessarily a good thing. IMO, I will continue to use this shampoo for a long time as my go-to and will continue to repurchase, but I will also keep experimenting with other shampoos that are not as drying for my fine, thin hair.", "review_title": "Great for sensitive skin, but..", "stars_data": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "images": null}, {"review_text": "Like a lot of other people using this product, I have issues with eczema, skin sensitivity, scalp sores, bumps, itching, dryness, and weird nightmarish rashes that pop up from time to time.

This one had good reviews and was safe for my color-treated hair, so I placed an order. After just a few uses, my scalp bumps and sores are FINALLY going away. I'm sold! You will definitely need to use conditioner with this shampoo. It does not produce a lot of lather, but it gets your hair and scalp squeaky clean and is safe on sensitive skin.

To me it's the same as receiving a completely different product altogether.  The one I got shampoos okay after which my hair is nice and soft.  But the one I want leaves my hair squeaky clean.  The clarifying shampoo clarifies like it says--it washes off the buildup (residue) of other crap on my hair  since the last wash which includes the molecules of hair conditioner, other stuff for styling purposes (I don't use), sebum (the natural oil from the sebaceous glands in the scalp), any applied hair oil (I don't use), and the dirt which clings better to hair covered with natural or commercial oils.  AFTER CLARIFYING my hair, I can alter the hair any way I want before the next hair wash.  In my case it includes just the right amount of hair conditioner to soften it before I comb it in the style I want.  That's it! I can't help but feel the supplier was out of CLARIFYING SHAMPOO and thought I'd never know the  difference.  No uh uh.  Not so. The supplier can say, \"Well why didn't you mail what we gave you back for a refund or replacement?\"  Anyone who has a life at all knows the answer to that question. Maybe next time I can find a good clarifying shampoo in a beauty shop, or drugstore, or grocery store.

Have tried other shampoos (at least the ones I'm not allergic to off the bat) and even with only a single washing they make my hair look totally fried and flatter than the proverbial pancake. Never happens with this shampoo. With this one, a single washing with the Awapuhi will resurrect my zombie hair from the walking dead.

My hair texture is a mix of some curly/some straight - so just a mixed bag of lifelessness if I do nothing. My routine is as follows to get the best from your products if you suffer from lifeless hair: 1. Wet hair thoroughly 2. Take only a quarter size of shampoo, rub your hands together and gently massage your scalp. 3. Get some water on your head to create a lather 4. Do not lather your ends 5. Let the water run through your hair until it runs clean 6. Take a cup of half apple cider vinegar and half water and lightly work it through your hair 7. Rinse your hair 8. It should feel \"squeaky\" which means that your hair is clean (if you use a lot of product, be sure to use a little more shampoo/vinegar until you achieve the squeak. I do not condition because my hair is not dry. I tend to have well-balanced natural moisture in my hair. Lightly condition the ends if you need to and rinse thoroughly. 9. Gently squeeze dry your hair 10. Wait until your hair is lightly dry naturally or lightly dry with blow dryer 11. Take a quarter size styling product into your fingers, not palms. Rub together your fingers and lightly work it through your hair starting at the roots. 12. Continuously fluff your hair with your fingers if you are air drying or now begin using the blow drier to lift it the way you want This routine has worked great for me for a long time.

I always had bouncy, light, shiny, easily styled hair that smelled great.  For whatever reason, around the age of 25, I thought I needed a change and moved on to other brands.  While I could keep a shine in my hair, or bouncy and light, I couldn't do shiny, bouncy healthy looking hair all at once.  As the years went by, my hair just became a little more dull, a little more listless, a little more unmanageable.  Always managed to keep the smelled great aspect as that's always been something important to me. In a random move a couple months ago I thought I'd give my old favorite shampoo a try.  OMG.  I will never use anything else again.  I have learned my lesson!  What I thought was my hair changing with my age and with pregnancies and environment and whatnot was just wrong.  Instantly I had my shiny, bouncy, light, easily styled, smells great hair back.  I am using this shampoo with the extra body rinse as my main conditioner and the detangler conditioner as desired.

I've read a lot about Amazon fulfillment combining counterfeit products with the actual seller's products, and I think it's possible that happened here. Two compelling reasons for this (aside from the effects mentioned above): 1) The bottle squeezes out an insane amount of product each time I use it (the size of a meatball almost). It's possible the top was just badly manufactured, but I haven't seen anything like this in previous OGX products. 2) There is not a strong \"minty\" smell or \"minty\" feel to the scalp. To me, this is one of the selling points of this conditioner, and it's not really noticeable with this product. 3) Hair doesn't really feel soft. Usually, when I use conditioner, my hair feels very soft when I'm letting it sit before rinsing - that doesn't seem to happen when I use this product.
